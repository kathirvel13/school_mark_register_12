# School Mark Register
This is a python script which I developed using the concepts taught in ***Class 12 Computer Science (CBSE)***.
You need to [install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run this program.
I have used the concept of **functions** and **data file handling** to complete this program.

This program stores the marks of students in a *csv file* along with their names and a system alloted roll number.
It can do the following.
- Add multiple entries of students at the same time
- Displays the data collected
- Displays maximum and minimum marks obtained subject-wise
- Remove student from register
